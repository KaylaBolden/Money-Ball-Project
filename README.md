## The challenge

Perform an end-to-end analysis putting into practice what you have learned so far. You will apply statistical or machine learning techniques and present your results to the class.

### Possible Outcomes

- Rank players by market value.
  
- Highlight the top players for their outstanding performances over a discrete season.
- Decide when to transfer a player.
- Decide the best replacement for a transferred player.

> You might suggest your own outcomes. Check with instructional staff before committing to a new option.

## Objectives

- Ask interesting and thoughtful questions and find the data to answer them.
  
- Focus on improving in areas that are hard for you or learning more about something with which you feel comfortable.
- Apply the statistical and machine learning techniques we have learned.
- Create useful and clear graphs.
- Present your insights in a thoughtful, clear, and accurate way.

## Dataset

In this project, you will use the provided [**fifa21_male2.csv**](https://github.com/Ironhack-Data-0621-Remote/Project_FIFA_MoneyBall/tree/main/Data) dataset.

[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/ekrembayar/fifa-21-complete-player-dataset?select=fifa21_male2.csv) details about the dataset can be found here as well. 

This data set includes:

   - **FC:** Fouls Committed
   - **FS:** Fouls Suffered
   - **YC:** Yellow Cards
   - **RC:** Red Cards

## Instructions & Scope

- You **CAN'T CODE** until your project is planned.
  
- Create a `*.gitignore*` file and include it in your repository.
- You should include a linear regression question(s) on the data.

## Deliverables

- Repository with your workflow + documentation + code. This repository must contain:
  
  - README: it is mandatory to present the project. 
    - What made you decide to do this project?
    - Objetive 
    - Used tools 
    - Workflow
    - Results and conlusions (this is not so obligatory, it is a more personal decision)

    ⚠️ Readme will be the first thing that people will see from us. A person who knows nothing about this project should be able to read your readme and know what you have done. 

- A SQL Database with the FIFA_MoneyBall, using the learned statements during the last weeks

- A well-commented Jupyter notebook with your analysis.

  ⚠️ Remember, you could use the markdown cells in jupyter!! 

- The final dataset after all cleaning and transformations.

- To send us your work... as always a pull request where in the comments leave us the link to your repo.


## Tips & Tricks

- Organize yourself (don't get lost!). Respect deadlines.
  
- Ask for help but don't forget that Google is your friend.
- Define a simple approach first. You never know how the data can betray you. :wink:
- Document your work.
- Learn about the problem and what research has been done before you.
- Before making a graph, think about what you want to represent.
